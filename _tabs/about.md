### Welcome to my website!

I'm Martin Chang, a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for computer vision, robotics, and additive manufacturing with several years of experience - industry and hobby included. In my downtime when I'm not tinkering with a 3D Printer or some other bit of hardware, I enjoy reading, writing, soccer, swimming, tennis and playing the piano. I'll never say no to some good old reality TV though!

I was born in Pyeongtaek, South Korea in 2001 and moved to Canada a few years after that. I've moved several times within my childhood around the GTA and London, Ontario - I'm no stranger to meeting new people and having to make friends, haha.

Some of my other hobbies include playing chess, trivia and following esports (LoL, CS, Smash). I mostly watch LCS/LEC in LoL with no real favourite team, I just support local talent from Canada there. I watch less LPL/LCK, but my favourite players there are Shanks and Showmaker in each respective league. I'm a Faze fan in CS (go Karrigan!), and no particular favourite in Smash, though I do enjoy watching guys like Tweek/Light/Raru/Snow.

I'm also a fan of all major Toronto sports - Jays, Raptors, Leafs, TFC. I also follow the Spurs across the pond in England. COYS!

I enjoy lots of variety of music - 70/80/90's Rock, Alternative, KPop, JPop, and OST/Scores of Movies/TV Shows/Other Media are what I listen to regularly.

Video Games are also always a guilty pleasure of mine. I mostly play singleplayer JRPGs and Western RPGs these days with some action-adventure titles, though I'll boot up LoL or CS2 with friends once in a while.

I play Smash semi-competitively on and off over the years. Mained Marth in Brawl, Lucina and Cloud in Smash 4, and currently play Diddy Kong and Greninja in Ultimate with some Wii Fit Trainer and Chrom mixed in.

I love reviewing stuff! Video Games, Movies, KDramas, etc. You can see them throughout my site.
