Quite possibly, potentially, maybe, the most famous game in the entire franchise, and one of all of gaming. It's a much yapped about game, and one who's characters are even famous in pop culture media. But was FF7 a good game?

The plot in this game... well it is iconic. The opening scene of Cloud in Midgar getting hired by eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE and on his way to destroy one of Shinra's (basically the government in Midgar) reactors that are sucking up mako from the planet (their version of oil, it's a kind of spiritual energy) was super iconic. And watching the plot evolve from there from one where the classist divide between poor people and the rich are at odds against each other in Midgar (rich live on the pizza in the city, poor live below it if you catch my drift) to a story of Cloud's revenge as the party leaves Midgar to hunt down Sephiroth and stop him from taking over the planet was infamous. The insanity begins when Cloud begins to lose his mind over the course of the game, making increasingly more questionable decisions, becoming one-track minded in trying to defeat Sephiroth, having schizophrenic attacks and even nearly _killing_ one of the most beloved party members in the franchise during a cutscene all of gaming would know. And yet it is the reveal at the Northern Crater that Cloud's purpose all this time was to be a puppet to help revive the real Sephiroth who had been hibernating in a glacier and allow him to nuke the planet of all living beings and to start anew on a different planet that was the greatest twist of all in the game.

Cloud is by far the most famous protagonist in the series. And I do think he is one of the best characters as well. The reveal of Cloud not hacking it as a Soldier when he left his hometown for Midgar, being a grunt in Shinra's army with mental issues preventing him from properly becoming a Soldier, getting caught up in the Nibelheim incident where he watched his mother get killed, his village burn down and see his childhood friend suffer mortal injuries, get captured and tested upon for years - thereby becoming a Soldier physically but not mentally - losing his best friend Zack shortly after escaping the lab before the trauma from years past finally caught up to him and made him think he _was_ Zack, and an idealized version of what a Soldier was. His story was jawdropping when you piece it together that the Jenova cells Cloud was injected with to become a Soldier turned him into a Sephiroth clone, which explained his immense gravitation to him. I found the sequence where Tifa pieced Cloud's psyche back together when they fell into the lifestream to be thematically beautiful, and Cloud having to admit to himself that he was weak, unable to save anyone in his hometown during the Nibelheim incident (well, I guess he did save Tifa in the reveal that _he_ was grunt #2 in the flashback) and even was a liability to his best friend in the end. Ultimately, accepting that he had failed to achieve any of his dreams and that it was finally time for him to face reality was a brutal, yet beautiful arc of self-acceptance. And it was only then that Cloud could properly move on and become the lame country bumpkin with a good heart and being freakishly strong like he used to be.

Conversely, Sephiroth and Jenova are the two main villains of the game. Everyone knows and loves the pretty boy!

Jenova was a calamity/parasite that landed on the FF7 world, infected a woman near where it landed, and had only one goal - drain the planet of mako/energy, then move onto the next. Another thing to note that hinted at the twist that Cloud was effectively a Sephiroth clone was the _Reunion_ theory that kept getting mentioned throughout the game, where Jenova cells would inevitably attempt to reunite with each other after some time. The idea was that Soldier's could receive Jenova cells to get a boost in physicality... at the cost of having to fight off Jenova's influence, which is why only the mentally strong could survive the experiments.

Sephiroth was a vector of this as someone who was injected with a lot of Jenova cells ever since he was in the womb and was the original soldier that Shinra made in their attempts to create biological weapons. We see in his flashback that he always _felt_ like he was special back when he was semi-normal and just a soldier in Shinra's army, and slowly loses his mind during the mission to Nibelheim when he realizes the purpose of his _mother_ and what his goal should be before burning down the village and kickstarting Cloud's very rapid mental decline. While we mostly just see Sephiroth clones/Jenova throughout the game until the Northern Crater, his backstory, how he became a villain, and his revival to continue his work was top tier as a character. But as a criticism, a lot of Sephiroth we see is flashbacks and other lore dumps in the past. We don't really see Sephiroth in action for 80% of the game. It's Jenova and Cloud, mostly. So, while I do think he's a great villain narratively, I don't think he's a great villain in the context of the game, if that makes sense.

The rest of the cast is iconic as well. Tifa is probably one of the most famous female characters in gaming (well, maybe for certain other reasons, LMAO), and was a great character in her own right as she helps Cloud fix himself. The hints that she gave that her account of Nibelheim and Cloud's was so weirdly accurate... yet also wrong because Cloud supposedly wasn't at the incident (well, he was, just disguised as Grunt #2) throughout the game was masterful foreshadowing that perhaps, Cloud was telling the story from his friend's perspective and not his own, haha.

Aerith of course was the driving force of the game after leaving Midgar... well, until Sephiroth/Jenova executed her, though I guess the party carried on in her name. I did find it an interesting plot point how Aerith seemed to realize before she ran off to the Forgotten Capital that Cloud was merely pretending to act like her ex-boyfriend Zack (yes, the same one as Cloud's best friend and the one who sacrificed himself for Cloud. Small world, eh?) and pieced it together before any of us did that Cloud was hiding behind a different persona. I also always liked the contrast that Tifa dresses very provacatively and is an extremely accomplished martial artist, yet is introverted and generally shy. On the flipside Aerith looks more conventionally "girly," but her personality is spunkier and sassier as a tomboy.

For the record, I've always been a CloTi shipper. She's his childhood friend, she's why he wanted to become strong, and quite literally the reason why he's sane now, FFS! And well, you know, she's also _alive._ Yeah, I said it.

As for the rest of the cast, Barret had a nice arc of his own personal issues with his adoptive daughter and her family. Red XIII had a very touching arc in his own hometown (Cosmo Canyon) where he confronts the resentment that his father was a deadbeat and a deserter but was in actuality, a war hero who died alone with no one to tell his tale. The others? Well, uh, not so much.

This game marked the transition to 3D from 2D in the series with the release of the PS1, although it's kinda like a hybrid type situation where the background is a static 2D image but you get certain screens that are 3D when you move around. Further, all the fights are in 3D. Some other gameplay shifts included materia replacing more classical magic - this means any of your characters can become white/black mages - and for the most part limit breaks (special moves each character can make once they've taken a certain amount of damage) are what determine who's a good character in combat or not. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the shift. Makes it feel like every character is the same. And of course, party size reduced to 3 from 4. Again, not a fan.

The OST in the game is legendary. _Opening: Bombing Mission_ is an infamous theme in all of gaming, the normal fight music and boss theme are also iconic. Sephiroth's theme (Those Chosen by the Planet) is another one that's famous. And who can forget the final boss theme, One Winged Angel? While I don't think this game is Nobuo Uematsu's best work, it is one of his most famous ones, and for good reason. It's an all-time OST.

So I aired out some of my greivances with the game already. But I have more. Maybe it was obvious from what I wrote about already, but the bizarre shift in narrative from Midgar to chasing Sephiroth was just... weird. I mean Midgar by itself was an interesting idea with the eco-terrorism. Then we chase Sephiroth for Cloud's personal issues/revenge. And then we cycle back to eco-terrorism and stopping Jenova/Sephiroth from using all the mako again? Whaaat??? Pick a lane square!

And I will say, FF7 did better than most other FF games, but it really did feel like this game just solely revolved around Cloud, with Tifa and Aerith being two major components in his story of overcoming his trauma. All the other characters were mostly just... comic relief outside of their arcs. Even Barret and Red became comic relief 😭😭

I don't know. FF7 was a _crazy_ ambitious game with what they tried. But I can't help but feel it was a bit all over the place. The stuff it did well, it completely knocked out of the park. The criticism of corporations not trying to use renewables in 1997 was pretty progressive, and Cloud's story of introspection and learning to be okay with failure is something that anyone can relate to. And I enjoyed writing about Cloud, Sephiroth, and their story here. But it was a mess to try and recap; it's hard to simplify it without missing major details, which is why I feel like I had to explain _everything_. And I'm not sure that's a good sign of good writing. But overall, I do think everyone should give it a try - it genuinely does have one of the most touching character arcs and interesting stories a video game has to offer.
